### Personal Project Description 

### AppleStore Personal Project 
-- During the Apple Store project, our goal was to assess the App market's potential and decide whether to develop an app and what type it should be. I was tasked with analyzing market data and providing actionable recommendations to guide our decision-making process. I used SQL to extract and analyze relevant data, identifying market trends and user preferences. I generated data-driven suggestions, collaborated with the team to align recommendations with business objectives, and presented my findings effectively. This approach led to informed decision-making, allowing us to assess the project's feasibility, and provide strategic recommendations for the type of app that would resonate with our target audience, ensuring focused and purposeful development efforts, ultimately enhancing the project's chances of success. 

### Excel Analysis and Dashboard
-- During the Excel project, I managed a dataset comprising 1001 bike sales and customer data, focusing on data cleaning, Pivot table creation for customer analysis, and the development of a user-friendly dashboard for customer segmentation. I meticulously cleaned and formatted the data, harnessed Pivot tables to extract insights into customer demographics and sales trends, and successfully delivered an interactive dashboard. This allowed for a streamlined data interpretation process and empowered data-driven decision-making, ultimately improving our understanding of customer behavior and sales performance.
